              <strong>Hitting the Goalie in the Mask</strong>
              <br>
              Thee player that hits the goalie in the mask during warmups.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>First Penalty</strong>
              <br>
              Thee Player who receives the first penalty of the game.
              <ol>
                <li>This rule is annulled if the player takes the penalty in the process of saving a goal. </li>
                <li>Annulment is invalid if said player causes the situation that results in a goal opportunity.</li>
                <li>This needs to be agreed upon by all parties, not just the player involved.</li>
                <li>
                  Clearing the crease does not constitute saving a goal.

              <br>
              Thee Player that takes a penalty in the offensive zone when we have possession of the puck.  Possession must be obvious and unarguable

              <strong>5-on-3</strong>

              <br>
              Thee Player who is assessed multiple penalties during the course of a game.  If a tie, the player who took the first of those penalties will be responsible
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Game Misconduct</strong>
              <br>

            <li>
              <strong>No Penalties and a shutout </strong>
              <br>
              If the Gorillas do not take any penalties during the course of a game AND the game is a shutout, thee goalie will select, at his sole discretion, thee Gorilla that shall bring beer.  Refusal to either bring beer or bringing crap beer out of spite may result in being repeatedly called a <em>“little bitch”</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Penalties, No Shutout</strong>
              <br>
              If, by unlikely happenstance, the Gorillas do not take any penalties during the course of a non shutout game, thee goalie shall bring beer.

            What's this all about?
          </h4>
          <p>
            This question has perplexed the team time and time again after each exhausting ice battle.  These new rules should put those questions to rest, at least for now.  These rules are fluid and can be edited as deemed fit.  The rules are ranked from lowest to highest, with each additional rule trumping the previous one(s).

              Majority rules.  Ties will be broken by the Captain.
